# ## The 6502 CPU
#
# ### Assembly:
# The main powerhouse of the emulator is the `CPU#load_asm()` method.
#
# The method allows you to type in 6502 asm code and run it through Crystal.<br>
# The assembler has the ability to use labels as well as a few custom instructions<br>
# It also uses a semicolon ';' for inline comments
#
# Example:
# ```
# ; Look at this cool comment!
# cpu = CPU.new(1.0, 0x0600_u16, CPU::RES_LOCATION - 2)
# cpu.load_asm("
# lda #$14
# ")
# cpu.execute
# puts cpu.accumulator
# ```
#
# To see all of the custom instructions, please see [custom_instructions.cr](https://github.com/D-Shwagginz/cr6502/blob/master/src/cr6502/instructions/custom_instructions.cr)
#
# Example:
# ```
# cpu.load_asm("
# prt 22
# ")
# cpu.execute # => puts "Type: UInt8 | Hex: 0x16 | Decimal: 22 | Binary: 0b00010110"
# ```
#
# The assembler also has some predefined labels:<br>
# `resvec:` will set the value at `RES_LOCATION` to the label's memory location.<br>
# `brkvec:` will set the value at `BRK_LOCATION` to the label's memory location.<br>
#
# Example:
# ```
# cpu = CPU.new(1.0, 0x0200_u16)
# cpu.load_asm("
# resvec:
# nop
# brkvec:
# ")
# puts cpu.peek(CPU::BRK_LOCATION, true).to_s(16) # => 200
# puts cpu.peek(CPU::RES_LOCATION, true).to_s(16) # => 201
# ```
#
# Being written in Crystal, you can use string interpolation when writing assembly code, giving access for any UInt8 and UInt16
# to be injected into the code.
#
# # Example:
# ```
# x = 0xa4
# cpu.load_asm("
# lda ##{x}
# ")
# cpu.execute
# puts cpu.accumulator.to_s(16) # => a4
# ```
#
# Note that the values are assigned at the assembler's compile time, therefore
#
# ```
# x = 0xa4_u8
# cpu.load_asm("
# lda ##{x}
# prt #{cpu.accumulator}
# ")
# cpu.execute                   # => puts "Type: UInt8 | Hex: 0x00 | Decimal: 0 | Binary: 0b00000000"
# puts cpu.accumulator.to_s(16) # => a4
# ```
#
# In the above example, at compile time, `cpu.accumulator` is set to 0. It only gets changed at the runtime of the code.<br>
# You can however achieve the hoped for effect by using multiple `CPU#load_asm` methods:
#
# ```
# x = 0xa4_u8
# cpu.load_asm("
# lda ##{x}
# ")
#
# cpu.execute
#
# cpu.load_asm("
# prt #{cpu.accumulator}
# ")
#
# cpu.execute # => puts "Type: UInt8 | Hex: 0xa4 | Decimal: 164 | Binary: 0b10100100"
# ```
#
# Be careful when doing this though as you must keep in mind that the memory has not reset, but using `CPU#load_asm` will reset the `CPU#program_counter`
# to its original value, or to the value of a `resvec:`
#
# This means that all the instructions set by any previous `CPU#load_asm`'s will still be there in memory.
#
# To counteract this issue, ensure that a brk is set at the end of any code
#
# You can however "append" code by setting the `start_location` of `CPU#load_asm` manually
#
# Example
# ```
# cpu = CPU.new(1.0, 0x0600_u16, CPU::RES_LOCATION - 2)
#
# cpu.load_asm("
# lda #01
# ")
#
# # Code = a9 01 #
#
# cpu.load_asm(0x0603"
# lda #01
# ")
#
# # Code = a9 01 a9 01 #
# ```
#
# You can also use `resvec:` to edit the default `CPU#program_counter` location when editing code
#
# Example
# ```
# cpu.load_asm("
# lda #01
# resvec:
# ")
#
# # Code = a9 01 #
#
# cpu.load_asm("
# lda #01
# ")
#
# # Code = a9 01 a9 01 #
# ```

  # Vector address for RESET
  RES_LOCATION = 0xfffc_u16
  # Vector address for BRK
  BRK_LOCATION = 0xfffe_u16

  # The flags of the cpu
  enum Flags
    # ### The Sign Flag
    # Sign Flag serves TWO purposes
    # 1) 	To signify the sigN of the last mathematical or bitwise operation.
    # 	The sign is the bit-7 of the result value.
    # 	If the last operation was not a signed operation, P.N will still reflect bit-7 of the result, but will NOT be considered as a sign.
    # 2) 	As a result store for a `CPU#bit` instruction:
    # 	The `CPU#bit` instruction reads the contents of the specified memory address and copies bit-7 of that value to the Sign Flag
    Negative
    # ### The Overflow Flag
    # P.V serves TWO purposes
    # 1) 	To signify an oVerflow (a sign change) during a mathmatical operation. Caused by an `CPU#adc` or `CPU#sbc` instruction:
    # 	If an `CPU#adc` or `CPU#sbc` instruction generates a result that would require more than 8 bits to hold (that is, any number outside the range -128 to 127) then Overflow is SET; else Overflow is CLEARed.
    # 	This flag may be ignored if the programmer is NOT using signed arithmetic.
    # 2) 	As a result store for a `CPU#bit` instruction:
    # 	The `CPU#bit` instruction reads the contents of the specified memory address and copies bit-6 of that value to P.V
    Overflow
    # ### The Break Flag
    # The Break Flag and the `CPU#brk` instruction seem to me to be one very badly thought out bodge.
    # If you do not plan to use the `CPU#brk` instruction I would just ignore it!
    # P.B is never actually set in the Flags register!
    # When a `CPU#brk` instruction occurs the Flags are PUSHed onto the Stack along with a return address*
    # It is only this copy of the Flags (the one on the Stack) that has P.B set!
    #
    # * This return address is actually "Address_of_BRK_instruction+2".
    # 	Bearing in mind that the `CPU#brk` instruction is only ONE byte long...
    # 	This means that if you simply issue an `CPU#rti`,
    # 	The byte immediately following the `CPU#brk` instruction will be ignored.
    # 	I have read reasons as to WHY this is the case, but frankly they all stink! ...Just deal with it!
    Break
    # ### The Decimal Flag
    # P.D dictates whether Addition (`CPU#adc`) and Subtraction (`CPU#sbc`) operate in the classic Binary or the more obscure [Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)](https://www.csh.rit.edu/~moffitt/docs/6502.html#BCD) mode.
    DecimalMode
    # ### The Interrupt (disable) Flag
    # When P.I is SET, Interrupt ReQuest signals (IRQs) to the IRQ pin (classically pin-4) are IGNORED
    # When P.I is CLEAR, signals to the IRQ pin are acknowledged.
    InterruptDisable
    # ### The Zero Flag
    # P.Z is SET when a zero value is placed in a register
    # P.Z is CLEARed when a non-zero value is placed in a register
    Zero
    # ### The Carry Flag
    # P.C can be considered to be the 9th bit of an arithmetic operation.
    Carry
